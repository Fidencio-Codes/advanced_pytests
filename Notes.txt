Advanced PyTest Notes 

# conftest.py exercise # - tested value declared in fixture across multiple tests in different functions

- conftest.py file makes the fixtures in it available to all tests within that folder.
- in the exercise is a fixture function with name 'input_value()' that, when invoked, returns integer 10.  


# test_retval1 exercise # - using conftest.py fixture for assert test 

- 'input_value()' fixture is used as a parameter in the test .
- the return value of 'input_value()' is assigned to a variable of the same name (in 'test_func_retval()' ).
- 'input_value' variable is compared for equality to the return value from invoking 'func_retval()'.
- ran pytest and it PASSES, as 10==10.


# parametrization exercises # - run tests multiple times with different inputs
- two types: test parametrization and fixture parametrization.

I. test parametrization
- used the 'pytest.mark.parametrize' decorator.
    - contains two arguments: str variables "numerator, operator" and a list.
    - first number in list will be used for numerator value.
    - second number will be used as the operator value.

- '%' modulo operator used (divides left by right, then returns the remainder).
- assert statement checks if a numerator divided by 5 has a remainder of 0.

- 'test_divisible_by_five()' test runs four times, iterating once per item on the list.
- only the third test should fail, the rest pass 
- ran 'pytest test_param.py -v' (-v flag for verbose output)


II. fixture parametrization
- class Numerator initializes single instance attribute, 'num_list', with default value [0,0].
- fixture decorator has a parameter list: 'params = [[...]]'.
    - 'params' keyword required, outer data structure is a list but inside values can be other data type.

- fixture function 'divisible_by_two' defined and has parameter 'request'.
- when this fixture function runs, pytest will run once per item on list. -- three times.
    - each iteration, pytest passes in request object.
    - pytest ensures that request object will have a param attribute with the current item from the 'params' list.
    - the function body is able to access and test each parameter. 

- 'divisible_by_two' instantiates an object of the Numerator class and returns it.
- object can now be accessed in a test function by using 'divisible_by_two' as a parameter.

- 'test_divisible_by_two' instantiates an object of the Numerator class, with different values for the 'num.list' attribute.
    - test runs three times, each time looping through one of the three lists.
    - ran 'pytest test_param.py -v' verbose flag.
    - as expected, two tests fail and the last one passes.


# command-line options for pytest exercise #

- a list of these command-line options can be seen using - pytest -h 
    - or online at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html#command-line-flags 

I. Stopping test suite after a certain number of test failures

- '--maxfail=num' option to stop a test suite after 'num' number of times 
- ran 'pytest test_nfailsuite.py -v --maxfail=1'
    - change the value for '--maxfail=#' (--maxfail=2 and --maxfail=3)
    - all tests should fail.


II. Run multiple test in parallel -- using pytest plugin pytest-xdist
- useful when test suites are very large 

- make sure your Python testing environment is activated
-   python -m pip install pytest-xdist

- '-n' option allows to specify number of tests to run in parallel 
- using test_param.py file
    - ran 'pytest test_param.py -v -n 3' 
    -three forked processes were spawned to run three tests in parallel
